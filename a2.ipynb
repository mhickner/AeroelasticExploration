    "## Dataset\n",
    "The data used in this exploration is from fluid-structure interaction simulations of a flexible plate in a moving fluid. The simulation is designed as a simplified version of a flapping insect wing. The raw dataset contains time-series data of the location of each element of the plate, and the time series of the coefficient of lift, which is affected by the shape of the plate. Also available is an algorithm to transform the timeseries data into a linear model. Some of the coefficients of the linear model should correspond to certain physical phenomenon, though verifying that is something that can be explored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The timeseries and raw data are available for several different angles of attack (the angle of the plate relative to the fluid flow), and for a range of flexibility, hopefully providing an interesting parameter landscape to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also some miscellaneous data available, such as the theoretical dominant mode shapes of the beam and their natural frequencies. Transformations of the data, such as eigenmodes, may be able to confirm the contribution of these theoretical mode shapes and frequencies to the actual deformation. "

    "## Preliminary Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *What is the most compact way (mathematically and visually) I can describe these deformations in a static visualization without throwing away too much information?* The plate can bend, and this deformation shows up in the data set as the location of each of 64 plate elements (may even need to transform the data to get these locations). Some possible options to explore: leading edge curvature? Trailing edge deflection? Contribution of each mode shape? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *How strongly correlated (in time) are coefficient of lift and plate deformation?* If there is strong, obvious correlation, is there some phase lag between them? Is the correlation between them strong at all times, or only at other times? This may be related to the previous question, since there is more than one version of “deformation” I could use to investigate this correlation.\n",
    "3. *What are the trends in theodorsen-like model coefficients across the parameter space of alpha0 and rigidity?* These coefficients come from transformations of the time series data of coefficient of lift and plate deformation, so again, the choice of measure of deformation may (or may not?) affect the answer to this."

    "The first step to look at this data using this Jupyter notebook is to format the data to be imported into a pandas dataframe. The data was outputted from the Fortran fluid structure interaction simulation, and I was provided with a post-processing script that turned the timeseries into Matlab arrays. This data set contains roughly 136 million data points, so my first question was whether I could either downsample the data to a lower time resolution, or chop off the beginning or end of each timeseries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the physics involved in the system, I am guessing that the case with the most deformation in the plate is the most flexible and has the highest angle of attack. I used this case to determine how much of the timeseries to use. These images were generated in Matlab, since the data has not yet been imported to this notebook. "

We were unable to see by eye changes over time in teh waterfall plot. The colorbar indicates that the differences between time points are very small. The first visualization showed clear trends over time, but the vertical axis scale is very zoomed in.  \n",

    "For now I will say that leading edge curvature is a good measure of deformation, but a possibility I am ignoring for now is that by using only one number (curvature) I am still missing some crucial information, like additional vibration modes. An option to explore in the future is to look at curvature at different locations along the plate to see if I can pick up any new vibration modes, or information about how deformations propagate from one edge of the plate to the other. \n",

    "Another direction I could go with the curvature is to notice that I can only see one vibration mode for the stiffest case. Is the second mode so small that I need to zoom in? Would looking at curvature at a different point on the plate show that second mode? If I don't find the second mode with, would collecting more data with a faster or slower pitching maneuver reveal a second mode?"

By eye, some observations are: 1) the frequency content of the lift and curvature signals look similar, 2) the overall rise and fall of lift looks correlated with, but not identical to that of curvature, 3) the lift signal has some sharp peaks that aren't seen in curvature. \n",

    "My first suspicion for why the lift data has spikes that aren't present in the curvature data is that it has something to do with the motion of the plate. Both deformation and lift can be affected not only by the pitch angle, but also the pitch velocity and pitch acceleration, due to inertial effects (the tendency for objects or fluids to keep going in whatever direction they are already going). Lift and plate deformation may also be affected by \"added mass\", which is when a moving object in a fluid pulls some fluid along with it, effectively changing the \"airfoil shape\" of the object."
